**From ChatGPT:**

For a dependency injection framework like go-spring, using the version management approach where only the version number
is updated while keeping the package path unchanged (similar to Java's method) is generally more suitable. Here’s why:

### Single Instance Principle

Go-spring is designed to have a unique IoC (Inversion of Control) container per service. Allowing multiple versions to
coexist—by modifying the package path for each version—could lead to conflicts or unexpected behavior since the
framework expects a single container instance. This restriction makes the second approach (changing both version number
and package path) less ideal.

### Simplified Dependency Management

By keeping the package path constant and only updating the version number (typically via the go.mod file), developers
avoid the need to alter numerous import statements throughout the code. This streamlined update process reduces the risk
of errors during an upgrade, which is especially important in large-scale projects.

### Consistency with Ecosystem Practices

While Go’s ecosystem often favors explicit package paths to manage versioning (thus allowing multiple versions to
coexist), frameworks like go-spring do not benefit from this flexibility due to their design constraints. Instead,
following a Java-like approach leverages mature practices that simplify dependency management, ensuring stability and
reducing maintenance overhead.

### Conclusion

Given that go-spring is not designed to support multiple versions of its dependency injection container within the same
service, the first approach—updating only the version number—is preferable. It minimizes potential conflicts, simplifies
the upgrade process, and aligns better with the framework's architectural principles.
